    Futures analog of attach_position() (D6/D2) — deliberately NOT shared

    instead of "final_recommended_shares"). Loads the report through the
    same hardened three-class loader vocabulary as contrarian-setup-gate /
    futures_sizing.py (unreadable / parse_error / non_finite — reused
    verbatim, no new tags).

    Validates:
      1. sizing_status == "SIZED" (rejects NO_TRADE and, incidentally, an
         equity position-sizer report, which has no sizing_status field).
      2. direction in {LONG, SHORT}.
      3. contracts is a positive whole number (P1-4: no fractional
         contracts).
      4. contract_spec.multiplier is a finite, non-bool, strictly-positive
         number.
      5. contract_spec.currency is present, a non-empty string, and equal
         to "USD" — no fallback to any other field (P1-2 / P1-addendum-3:
         this skill has no FX conversion — a non-USD contract's P&L would
         silently be computed in the WRONG currency's magnitude; fail
         closed instead).
      6. If expected_entry/expected_stop given, must match the report's
         top-level entry/stop (same 0.01 tolerance as attach_position()).
      7. _ATTACH_FUTURES_ALLOWED status guard — IDEA/ENTRY_READY ONLY
         (P1-1: stricter than equity's _ATTACH_ALLOWED, which also allows
         ACTIVE). Re-attaching on ACTIVE would silently overwrite the
         entire position dict incl. `direction` of an already-open
         futures position — a sign-flip that corrupts every subsequent
         P&L computation with no error raised. See
         _ATTACH_FUTURES_ALLOWED's module-level docstring.
      8. Cross-attach guard (P1 addendum, user re-review): rejects a
         thesis that already has an EQUITY position attached (same root
         cause and symmetric fix as attach_position()'s cross-attach
         guard above — IDEA/ENTRY_READY are in both status allow-sets, so
         the status guard alone can't stop an equity position from being

        final ledger entry; here we only sum + finalize).

    Precondition: thesis has a position with shares (legacy / no-position
    theses keep their pre-PR-80B code path in the caller and never reach here).

    Output-side finiteness (Issue #254, pre-existing money-critical gap —
    same "guard the OUTPUT, not just the input" principle and the same
    two-layer arithmetic/finiteness pattern as `_finalize_futures_outcome()`):
    every value computed here (proceeds, realized_pnl,
    cumulative pnl_dollars via `_sum_realized()`, pnl_pct) is computed
    into a LOCAL variable and validated finite BEFORE any mutation of
    `thesis`/`position`/`status_history`. Validation is TWO layers, both
    required:

      1. `try/except OverflowError` around the arithmetic itself. A huge
         Python int operand (e.g. a disk-corrupted `shares: 10**400` that
         bypassed `_validate_thesis()` at write time — see D1's
         `_validate_equity_position_fields()`, which only runs on
         `_save_thesis()`, not on read) makes `round(10**400 * 1.5, 2)`
         raise `OverflowError` from *inside* the multiplication —
         `math.isfinite()` is never reached. Verified empirically.
      2. `math.isfinite()` on the result, for the case where the
         arithmetic itself succeeds but produces `inf`/`nan` (e.g.
         `shares = float("inf")`, which multiplies cleanly to `inf`
         without raising).

    Both layers apply to `math.isfinite()` itself too, not just the
    preceding arithmetic — `_sum_realized()` over an all-Python-int
    ledger can return a huge *int* result (no float ever entered the
    computation, so `round()` doesn't raise), and `math.isfinite()` on
    THAT huge int raises OverflowError in turn. Each finiteness check
    below therefore lives inside the same `try` as the value it checks.
