# Claude Trading Skills

Claude Trading Skills started as a personal project to use AI to improve my own trading process.

Claude Trading Skills is a Claude Skills-based trading workflow toolkit for time-constrained individual investors.

It is designed for investors who use long-term investing, ETFs, and dividend stocks as their core, while using disciplined swing trading as a satellite strategy when market conditions are favorable.

The goal is not to outsource buy/sell decisions to AI. The goal is to structure market review, risk management, trade planning, journaling, and continuous improvement. It is open source because the workflows, checklists, and review habits behind better trading decisions can improve through shared practice.

This is not a signal service or a promise of profitability. It is a toolkit for traders who want to build a better decision process.

The project follows a **first for self, open for others** stance: it is built first as a practical workflow the author uses, then shared openly for others who face similar constraints.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for educational, research, and process-improvement purposes only. It is not financial advice, investment advisory service, tax advice, legal advice, a signal service, or a broker execution platform. Trading and investing involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance, backtests, screens, reports, and AI-generated analysis do not guarantee future results. All trading decisions, position sizing, tax/regulatory compliance, and broker usage are the user's responsibility.

The project is provided under the MIT License, **AS IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY**.

## Who This Is For

This repository is designed for:

- Time-constrained individual investors
- Long-term investors who also want disciplined swing-trading upside
- Dividend and ETF investors who want structured portfolio review
- Traders who want to manage risk before finding trade candidates
- Investors who want to journal and improve their decision process

It is not designed for fully automated trading, signal outsourcing, or short-term scalping.

## Recommended Starting Path

New users should start with one of these operational workflows. Each link points to a machine-readable manifest under [`workflows/`](workflows/) that names the exact skills, decision gates, and artifacts in order.

| Goal | Workflow | Anchor Skills | API Profile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15-minute daily market check | [`market-regime-daily`](workflows/market-regime-daily.yaml) | market-breadth-analyzer, uptrend-analyzer, exposure-coach | No API for basic path |
| Weekly long-term portfolio review | [`core-portfolio-weekly`](workflows/core-portfolio-weekly.yaml) ([sample](examples/workflows/core-portfolio-weekly/sample-run/)) | portfolio-manager, kanchi-dividend-review-monitor, trader-memory-core | Alpaca required; manual CSV is a degraded fallback |
| Find swing candidates only when risk is allowed | [`swing-opportunity-daily`](workflows/swing-opportunity-daily.yaml) ([sample](examples/workflows/swing-opportunity-daily/sample-run/)) | vcp-screener, drawdown-circuit-breaker, technical-analyst, position-sizer, trader-memory-core, pre-trade-discipline-gate | FMP for screeners; local state for risk and discipline gates |
| Record and learn from every closed trade | [`trade-memory-loop`](workflows/trade-memory-loop.yaml) | trader-memory-core, signal-postmortem | No API for manual path |
| Review monthly performance and adjust rules | [`monthly-performance-review`](workflows/monthly-performance-review.yaml) ([sample](examples/workflows/monthly-performance-review/sample-run/)) | trader-memory-core, signal-postmortem, backtest-expert | No API for manual path |

See [`workflows/README.md`](workflows/README.md) for how to read a manifest and run it manually. For a one-page "which workflow fits my situation?" guide, see [Find Your Workflow](docs/en/find-your-workflow.md) ([日本語](docs/ja/find-your-workflow.md)).

New here? Follow [Your First Week](docs/en/your-first-week.md) ([日本語](docs/ja/your-first-week.md)) from installation through a no-paid-data-API market check, first journal entry, and first weekly review.

### What This Actually Costs

Claude Web Skills are currently available on Free, Pro, Max, Team, and
Enterprise accounts; see Anthropic's
[current Skills help](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-use-skills-in-claude)
because access can change. Claude Code has separate account requirements, and
the Claude.ai Free plan does not include it; see the
[Claude Code setup guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/getting-started).
FMP, FINVIZ Elite, and Alpaca are optional data or broker integrations for
specific workflows. The five-skill starter path below works with public CSVs,
chart screenshots, and local files, so it does not require a paid market-data
API subscription.

### No API Key Starter Path

If you do not have FMP / FINVIZ / Alpaca subscriptions, start with these five skills and run them manually:

1. `market-breadth-analyzer` — public CSV breadth scoring; no API key
2. `uptrend-analyzer` — public CSV uptrend participation; no API key
3. `position-sizer` — pure calculation; no I/O
4. `trader-memory-core` — local YAML journaling
5. `signal-postmortem` — review framework

This path lets you review market conditions, size trades, journal decisions, and review outcomes **without paid data APIs**. Note: "no API" does not mean "no external data" — these skills still need public CSVs, chart screenshots, or local files. See each skill's `integrations:` entry in [`skills-index.yaml`](skills-index.yaml) for exact input requirements.

> **Canonical source:** [`skills-index.yaml`](skills-index.yaml) is the authoritative index of all skills. If this README, `CLAUDE.md`, or docs disagree with the index, the index is correct. The same applies to multi-skill workflows — [`workflows/*.yaml`](workflows/) is canonical.

## Repository Layout
- `skills/<skill-name>/` – Source folder for each trading skill. Contains `SKILL.md`, reference material, and any helper scripts.
- `skills-index.yaml` – Canonical metadata index for every skill (id, category, integrations, workflows back-references).
- `workflows/` – Operational workflow manifests for the Core + Satellite routines (canonical, validator-enforced via `--strict-workflows`).
- `skill-packages/` – Pre-built `.skill` archives ready to upload to Claude's web app **Skills** tab.
- `docs/` – Documentation site content, generated skill pages, and `docs/dev/metadata-and-workflow-schema.md` (schema spec).
- `scripts/` – Repository-level automation, including the schema validator and one-shot bootstrap helper.
- `skillsets/` – Purpose-specific install bundles defining required / recommended / optional skills for major goals (4 core skillsets shipped: market-regime, core-portfolio, swing-opportunity, trade-memory; consumed by the Navigator).

## Getting Started

First time here? Read the [FAQ](docs/en/faq.md) for plan, cost, safety, and scope
answers.

### Use with Claude Web App
1. Download the `.skill` file that matches the skill you want from `skill-packages/`.
2. For an individual account, open **Settings > Capabilities** and enable **Code execution and file creation**. Team and Enterprise users may need an organization owner to enable Skills.
3. Open **Customize > Skills**, upload the ZIP, confirm it appears in the list, and enable it if needed (see Anthropic's [current Skills help](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-use-skills-in-claude)).

### Use with Claude Code (desktop or CLI)
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the desired skill folder (e.g., `backtest-expert`) to `~/.claude/skills/` for personal use or `.claude/skills/` inside a project (see the [Claude Code setup guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/getting-started)).
3. Claude Code detects changes in an existing skills directory. Restart it only if you created the top-level skills directory after the session started.

> Tip: `.skill` packages are built from the source folders with tests and local build artifacts omitted. Edit a source folder if you want to customize a skill, then run `python3 scripts/package_skills.py --skill <skill-name>` before uploading to the web app.

## Companion Work Package

Want a ready-to-run agent-style workflow? See the companion
[Hermes Trading Research Agent Work Package](https://github.com/tradermonty/hermes-trading-research-agent-work-package).

It packages these skills into a Hermes profile with task-oriented slash-command routines such as
`/pre-market-routine`, `/after-close-review`, `/trade-journal`, `/weekly-portfolio-review`, and
`/monthly-performance-review`.

This is a research, journaling, and risk-review assistant, **not** an automated trading system.
It does **not** place orders, provide a signal service, or run hidden scheduled jobs;
**human decision gates remain central**.

5. Review a rebalancing plan and decide manually which actions, if any, to take

### Statistical Arbitrage Opportunities
1. Use **Pair Trade Screener** to identify cointegrated stock pairs within sectors
2. Analyze mean-reversion metrics (half-life, z-score) and hedge ratios
3. Use **Technical Analyst** to confirm technical setups for both legs of the pair
4. Monitor entry/exit signals based on z-score thresholds
5. Track spread convergence and manage market-neutral positions

### Skill Quality & Automation

- **Data Quality Checker** (`data-quality-checker`)
  - Validates data quality in market analysis documents and blog articles before publication.
  - 5 check categories: price scale inconsistencies (ETF vs futures digit hints), instrument notation consistency, date/weekday mismatches (English + Japanese), allocation total errors (section-limited), and unit mismatches.
  - Advisory mode — flags issues as warnings for human review, exit 0 even with findings.
  - Supports full-width Japanese characters (％, 〜), range notation (50-55%), and year inference for dates without explicit year.
  - No API key required — works offline on local markdown files.

- **Skill Designer** (`skill-designer`)
  - Generates Claude CLI prompts for designing new skills from structured idea specifications.
  - Embeds repository conventions (structure guide, quality checklist, SKILL.md template) into the prompt.
  - Lists existing skills to prevent duplication. Used by the skill auto-generation pipeline's daily flow.
  - No API key required.

- **Dual-Axis Skill Reviewer** (`dual-axis-skill-reviewer`)
  - Reviews skill quality using a dual-axis method: deterministic auto scoring (structure, workflow, execution safety, artifacts, tests) and optional LLM deep review.
  - 5-category auto axis (0-100): Metadata & Use Case (20), Workflow Coverage (25), Execution Safety & Reproducibility (25), Supporting Artifacts (10), Test Health (20).
  - Detects `knowledge_only` skills (no scripts, references only) and adjusts scoring expectations to avoid unfair penalties.
  - Optional LLM axis for qualitative review (correctness, risk, missing logic, maintainability) with configurable weight blending.
  - Supports `--all` flag to review every skill at once, `--skip-tests` for quick triage, and `--project-root` for cross-project review.
  - No API key required.

- **Skill Idea Miner** (`skill-idea-miner`)
  - Mines Claude Code session logs for skill idea candidates, scores them for novelty/feasibility/trading value, and maintains a prioritized backlog.
  - Used by the weekly skill auto-generation pipeline. Can also be run manually.
  - No API key required.

## Contributor Automation

The self-improvement and skill-generation pipelines are maintainer workflows,
not beginner trading steps. See the [Skill Automation Quickstart](docs/dev/skill-automation.md)
([日本語](docs/dev/skill-automation.ja.md)) for behavior, side effects, manual commands, and macOS scheduling.

## Customization & Contribution
- Update `SKILL.md` files to tweak trigger descriptions or capability notes; ensure the frontmatter name matches the folder name when zipping.
- Extend reference documents or add scripts inside each skill folder to support new workflows.
- When distributing updates, regenerate the matching `.skill` file in `skill-packages/` so web-app users get the latest version:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/package_skills.py --skill <skill-name>
  ```
